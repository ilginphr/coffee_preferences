# ðŸŒ€ Agile/Scrum Project Structure â€“ Coffee Preference App

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

This project was developed in a single day using the Agile mindset and Scrum structure in a simplified solo format. The goal was to build a functional and deployable machine learning app using Streamlit that predicts users' coffee preferences.

---

## âœ… Agile Principles Applied

- **Incremental development:** The project was completed in small, functional parts (data, model, interface, deployment).
- **Working software over documentation:** The app was deployed and usable at the end of the day.
- **Individuals and interactions:** As a solo project, all roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer) were simulated by the same individual.

## ðŸ”§ Scrum Elements Used

### âœ” Product Backlog
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Label encoding for categorical variables
- Training a decision tree model
- Building the Streamlit interface
- Connecting model to UI
- Deploying to Streamlit Cloud
- Writing documentation (README, requirements)

### âœ” Sprint (Simulated as One-Day Sprint)
- Time-boxed to a single focused day
- All development steps completed sequentially
- No formal daily stand-up (solo project)

### âœ” Retrospective (Self-assessment)
- **What went well:**  
  - Smooth Streamlit UI integration  
  - Fast deployment to Streamlit Cloud  
  - Clean modular code structure  

- **What could be improved:**  
  - Limited dataset for generalization  
  - No automated unit testing yet  

- **Next steps (future improvements):**  
  - Expand the dataset  
  - Add testing and validation pipeline  
  - Enable user feedback collection

## ðŸ“Œ Note


While the project was completed in a single development session, the structure and philosophy of Agile and Scrum were deliberately followed to simulate a professional workflow.
